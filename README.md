# brew_app
My second project for General Assembly, a full-stack app for beer.

Access here: https://polar-plateau-90548.herokuapp.com

MVP:
Host my CRUD app on Heroku to allow users to create a user and log in/log out to save what beers they like and dislike.

Technologies Utilized: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, mustache-express, pg-promise, body-parser, method-override, express-session, request, bcrypt, Heroku, Github, BreweryDB API

User Stories: 
As a user, I want to have access to the Brewery DB API via the youBREW app and be able to login so I can keep track of what beers I like and dislike.

Unsolved Problems: 
Some minor styling issues
How to keep user logged in for longer.
How to make deleted/changed beer preference show up on the right view without having to refresh the page.

Thanks for the API!
